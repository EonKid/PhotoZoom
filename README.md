PhotoZoom
===================

### iOS project to show how to use gestures to zoom a photo.

### Overview

There are lots of photo browsing projects. You can find some on [Cocoa Controols](http://www.cocoacontrols.com/tags/photo) but I
did not find they met my needs. I wanted something that is very simple which could be dropped into an app easily. This solution
is simply an extension of UIScrollView with the addition of tap gestures.

The project was built by referencing the PhotoScroller and AutoScroll samples from Apple.
